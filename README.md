# Memory-Game

This is a front-end memory game created with ReactJS. Users are prompted to click flags one-by-one, trying not to click the same flag twice. With each click, the flags' positions shuffle and the score increases. If a user clicks a flag a second time, the score resets. The site features dynamic components including flashing titles, hover captions, and live scorecards.
